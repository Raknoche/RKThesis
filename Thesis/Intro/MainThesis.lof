The dotted line indicates the contribution of baryonic gas, the dashed line indicates the contribution of visible matter in the disk, and the dash-dotted line indicates the contribution of dark matter.

The light is deflected by a massive lens at L, and causes the image seen by the observer to appear at an angle $\theta $. D$_{LS}$, D$_L$, $\theta $, and $\beta $ are, respectively, the distance from the lens plane to the source plane, the distance from the lens plane to the observer, the angle of the image relative to the observer, and the angle of the source relative to the observer. \cite {Bin-Nun} \relax }}{13}{figure.2}

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {7}{\ignorespaces A depiction of the effect of baryons on the oscillating plasma during BAO. The mass of the baryons loads down the plasma, producing an asymmetry in the oscillations in which the plasma compresses further toward the minimum of the potential well. Since the CMB power spectrum does not care about the sign of the fluctuation, we see that the odd numbered peaks become enhanced over the even numbered peaks. \cite {Whu} \relax }}{22}{figure.7}
