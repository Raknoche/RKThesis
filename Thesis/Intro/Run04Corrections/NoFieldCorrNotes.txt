g1=0.105, ee=0.98 <- TOTALLY UNREASONABLE ee FOR OUR FIELD, SHOULD BE MORE LIKE 0.7-0.8

2014 lifetime = 374, 2015 lifetime= 351
Again, totally unreasonable, way to fucking low.. leads to worse energy resolution
latest krypcal: 2014 lifetime = 1,008 and 2015 lifetime = 1126

best_total_chi2 =

    3.3719


best_total_kr_chi2 =

    1.6754


best_total_h3_chi2 =

    5.0684

Poor reduced chi2. (twice as bad as the field corrected method for CH3T)

Without field corrections, KrypCal makes the Kr83m S1 and S2 signal uniform everywhere in the detector, 
yet the total energy spectrum still has a z dependence due to recombination variation in the field that
should NOT have been made uniform
